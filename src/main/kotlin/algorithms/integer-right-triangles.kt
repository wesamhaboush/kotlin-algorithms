/*
Integer right triangles
Problem 39
If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

solution ideas:

a + b + c = p
a^2 + b^2 = c^2

for each p, scan for the right solution? sounds crude

There is a theorem by Wade called Height-excess Theorem. It states that for all integers
(h, k), the triples are:

(h + dk, dk + (dk)^2 / 2h, h + dk + (dk)^2 / 2h )

where to find d, you put h as pq^2, where p is square free, and q positive.
Set d = 2pq if p is odd, or d = pq if p is even

There is also Dickson's methods, which says:

To find integer solutions to x^2+y^2=z^2, find positive integers r, s, and t such that
r^2=2st is a square.

Then:

x=r+s,y=r+t,z=r+s+t

From this we see that r is any even integer and that s and t are factors of (r^2)/2.
All Pythagorean triples may be found by this method
