Combinatoric selections
Problem 53
There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, 5C3 = 10.

In general,

nCr =	n! / r!(n−r)! where r ≤ n, n! = n x (n−1) x ... x 3 x 2 x 1, and 0! = 1.
It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: 23C10 = 1144066.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of  nCr, for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, are greater than one-million?

Solution Analysis:

use pascal triangle row calculation to find out those numbers.
